Learn Python The Hard Way | Zed Shaw

The purpose of this repository is to track my work on Zed Shaw's "Learn Python 3 The Hard Way" course.  You can learn more about this course by going to Zed Shaw's "Learn Code the Hard Way" website at https://shop.learncodethehardway.org/.

I'm beyond the beginner phase of learning python, but am starting from the beginning of this course as a way to drill the basics and maintain my skills through regular practice.
