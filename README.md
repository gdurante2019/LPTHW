Learn Python The Hard Way | Zed Shaw

The purpose of this repository is to track my work on Zed Shaw's "Learn Python 3 The Hard Way" course.  More information about this course can be found at Zed Shaw's "Learn Code the Hard Way" website:  https://shop.learncodethehardway.org/.

I'm beyond the beginner phase of learning python, but am starting from the beginning of this course to drill the basics and maintain my skills through regular practice.
